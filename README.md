# Arduino-Files
This is a collection of all my Arduino files which contains some codes of my projects done in Arduino.

This repository mainly contains codes which led to three projects I created which were:
1. Weather Balloon Satellite - A helium filled balloon with pressure, humidity, temperature and other types of sensor to measure how these parameters change as they go up the atmosphere.
2. Internet of Things Light switch on and off - Creating a program using Node MCU on how I can switch a bulb or any electric device on and off using the internet.
3. RFID Baggage Tag Project - Creating a program to identify the last known location of missing bags using RFID tags via mobile numbers.
